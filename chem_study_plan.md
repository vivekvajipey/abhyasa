# USNCO Local Exam 2026 Study Plan with Resources

**Goal**: Score 57+/60 on the USNCO Local Exam by March 1, 2026  
**Start Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Duration**: 6 months  
**Daily Commitment**: 2-3 hours  

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (September - October 2025)
*Focus: Master AP Chemistry level content and begin expanding beyond*

### Primary Resources:

**Zumdahl Chemistry (9th or 10th edition)**
- **Link**: [Amazon - Zumdahl Chemistry 10th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Chemistry-Steven-S-Zumdahl/dp/1305957601)

**Dr. Chen's USNCO FAQ**
- **Link**: [dcho.us - FAQs](https://dcho.us/faqs)
- **Justification**: Comprehensive guide addressing common preparation questions, written by one of the most successful USNCO coaches. Includes strategic advice beyond just content knowledge.

## Phase 2: Advanced Topics (November - December 2025)
*Focus: Master topics beyond AP Chemistry that appear frequently on USNCO*

### Primary Resources:

**Klein Organic Chemistry (2nd-4th edition)**
- **Link**: [Amazon - Klein Organic Chemistry 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Organic-Chemistry-David-R-Klein/dp/1119659590)
- **Justification**: Universally endorsed as "the most recommended book" for USNCO organic preparation by successful participants. Top performers specifically work through the first 20 chapters, praising Klein's skills-based approach ideal for self-study.

**Atkins Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight**
- **Link**: [Amazon - Atkins Chemical Principles 7th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Principles-Quest-Insight-Peter/dp/1464183953)
- **Justification**: Professor Jianping Huang, who has coached multiple IChO team members, uses this as his core text. Provides the mathematical rigor needed for USNCO's most challenging problems.

**CODSite Textbook Recommendations**
- **Link**: [chem.isodn.org - Textbook Recommendations](https://chem.isodn.org/faq/textbook_recommendations)
- **Justification**: The Chemistry Olympiad Development Squad (CODS) consists of former Study Camp participants who provide peer-validated resource recommendations specifically for olympiad preparation.

### Specialized Topics:

**CODS Resources and Mock Tournaments**
- **Link**: [Chemistry Olympiad Development Squad](https://chem.isodn.org/)
- **Justification**: Run by former Study Camp participants, CODS provides the most olympiad-specific practice available outside official channels. Their mock tournaments simulate actual competition conditions.

## Phase 3: Integration and Problem-Solving (January 2026)

### Primary Resources:

**Past USNCO Local Exams (2021-2024)**
- **Link**: [ACS USNCO Past Exams](https://www.acs.org/education/students/highschool/olympiad/pastexams.html)
- **Justification**: Recent exams best reflect current question styles and difficulty. AoPS instructors emphasize: "If you are serious about making the camp, the best additional thing to do is to take all of the practice USNCO exams."

**AoPS ChemWOOT**
- **Link**: [Art of Problem Solving - ChemWOOT](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/woot-chem)
- **Justification**: Chemistry Worldwide Online Olympiad Training, designed specifically for serious olympiad competitors. Taught by former olympians and provides problems beyond standard curriculum.

**IChO Preparatory Problems**
- **Link**: [IChO Information Center](https://www.ichosc.org/)
- **Justification**: While more advanced than USNCO local exam, exposure to international-level problems builds confidence and reveals deeper chemical principles.

## Phase 4: Final Sprint (February 2026)

### Primary Resources:

**2025 USNCO Local Exam** (when available)
- **Link**: Will be posted on [ACS USNCO page](https://www.acs.org/education/students/highschool/olympiad/pastexams.html)
- **Justification**: Most recent exam provides the best final practice. Typically released by late summer/early fall.

**Personal compilation of weak areas**
- Create your own resource based on mistakes from practice exams
- **Justification**: Successful students report that maintaining a "mistake notebook" and drilling personal weak points is crucial for breaking through score plateaus.

## Cross-Phase Resources

**AoPS Chemistry Community Forums**
- **Link**: [AoPS Chemistry Forum](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c85_chemistry)
- **Justification**: Active community of olympiad participants and alumni. Excellent for getting help on difficult problems and finding study partners.

**USNCO Preparation Community (ACS)**
- **Link**: [ACS USNCO Community](https://communities.acs.org/t5/USNCO-Preparation/bd-p/usnco-preparation)
- **Justification**: Official ACS community for USNCO preparation, includes advice from coordinators and past participants.

**Additional High-Signal Resources Mentioned by Top Scorers:**

**Rishab Academy USNCO Guide**
- **Link**: [Rishab Academy - USNCO Guide](https://rishabacademy.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-winning-chemistry-olympiad-usnco/)
- **Justification**: Created by successful olympiad participants, provides strategic preparation advice beyond just content.

**Princeton STEM Courses (if accessible)**
- **Link**: [PRISMS Olympiad Courses](https://prismsus.org/programs/psc)
- **Justification**: Mentioned by multiple successful students as providing rigorous olympiad-specific training.

## Important Notes on Resources:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Successful students emphasize mastering these core resources rather than trying to use everything available.

2. **Free vs. Paid**: Most essential resources (past exams, Dr. Chen's annotations, MIT OCW) are free. The textbooks are the main expense but are considered non-negotiable by top performers.

3. **Version Flexibility**: For textbooks, recent editions (within 5 years) are fine. The core content doesn't change significantly between editions.

4. **Access Issues**: If you cannot access certain resources (like ChemWOOT), focus on maximizing the freely available materials, especially past exams with annotations.
